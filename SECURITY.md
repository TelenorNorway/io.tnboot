# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to investigate the security of Telenor
Boot. The security of Telenor Boot is our topmost priority. We
appreciate investigative work into system security by
well-intentioned, ethical security researchers. If you discover a
vulnerability, however small, we would like to know about it to
address it with appropriate measures as quickly as possible. This
document outlines the method we use to work with the security research
community to address framework security.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please open a new [Security advisory] with your findings. We strive to
resolve all problems as quickly as possible, and are more than happy
to play an active role in publication of writeups after the problem is
resolved.

Try to include as much information as possible in the initial report,
so we can quickly address the issue.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities in the public issue
tracker**

### Please do the following

- Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have
  discovered, for example by downloading more data than necessary to
  demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Do not publish or reveal the problem until it has been resolved.
- Do not use attacks on physical security or applications of third
  parties, social engineering, distributed denial of service or spam.
- Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we
  will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. Usually, a list
  of steps leading to the problem will be sufficient, and the
  vulnerable Telenor Boot version is enough. More complex
  vulnerabilities may require further explanation.

### Our commitment to you

- If you act in accordance with this policy, we will not take legal
  action against you in regard to your report.
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass
  on your personal details to third parties without your permission.
